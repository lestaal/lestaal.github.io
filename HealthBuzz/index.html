                <p>The major health issues currently impacting youth are chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Thus, the health of adolescents today - a major determinant of their future potential - is inextricably linked to the health-related behaviors they adopt during this formative period of their lives.</p>
                <p>Currently, there is no standardized, engaging health curriculum in Texas to help students learn about critical issues like nutrition, tobacco use, and vaccination.</p>
                <p>HealthBuzz is a nonprofit delivering accessible, tech-based, health education solutions that cater to and resonate with today’s youth.  By developing informative yet engaging solutions to the health education deficit, we want to empower students to pursue healthy lifestyles and decisions.</p>

                <h2>Engaging Lessons</h2>
                <p>We use evidence-based methods to optimize retention of information and engage students, using fun presentations to introduce students to the selected topic in health education. We have developed activities and videos interspersed throughout our presentation to enhance the learning process and make it an experience that resonates with students and creates a long-lasting impression on their health habits.</p>

                <h2>Tech-Based Learning Platform</h2>
                <p>One of our main selling points is our cultural currency.  As college students, we know what youth today is interested in and what will grab adolescents’ attentions.  Thus, our materials are all published online in formats that are graphics-heavy yet informative, and provide “snapshots” of information, so that kids are not forced to read long textbook pages to receive the vital information they need to maintain healthy lifestyles.  For example, check out

                <h2>Interactive Learning Experience</h2>
                <p>All of our presentations incorporate hands-on activities, as this is an empirically-proven strategy to improve retention.  By creating visual demonstrations of the information we present, we hope to leave the students with a lasting image of the dangers posed by the chronic diseases that threaten youth today, motivating them to move towards a healthier lifestyle.</p>
